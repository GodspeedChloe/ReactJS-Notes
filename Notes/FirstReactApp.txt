In our editor (VS Code recommended) we can see that we have a src code folder and a public folder.

Src is our React source code.
Public is our public facing documents and files such as index.html.

We can see when we view public/index.html (the homepage) we can see the following div:
<div id="root"></div>

This div is where the React app appears. It is the container for the React application.

The App component is responsible for rendering the black portion with the React icon in the browser.
