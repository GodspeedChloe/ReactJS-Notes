This is our truly first edited React app!

React works great transferring data from the compiled code into the running code, and what will happen is that the running application will get updated by React after a save occurs.  React will compare the new React elements to the old and figure out what has changed, updating on the fly.

element is a React element which exists in the Virtual DOM.  We import ReactDOM and now we can render it to the real DOM:

  ReactDOM.render(element,document.getElementById('root'));

The first parameter is what we want to render, and the second is where we want to render it in the real DOM.
