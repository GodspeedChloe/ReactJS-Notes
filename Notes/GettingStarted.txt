Getting started can be the most daunting part of getting into web dev, especially with newer frameworks and paradigms if you've spent years with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Here is one way in order to begin development with a lightweight dev server. 

Download npm (node package manager).  On Ubuntu/Debian: 
sudo apt-get install npm -y

There is no need to install the npm package create-react-app as it comes with npx, and npx comes with npm versions 5.2+.  If you accidentally install create-react-app globally, go ahead and remove it with:
sudo npm uninstall -g create-react-app.

So now we run the following command:
sudo npx create-react-app my-app

create-react-app will install:
Development Server
Webpack (for bundling our files)
Babel (for compiling our JavaScript code)
+ more tools

After having created your project (you can name it something other than my-app), you can start the server with:
cd my-app
sudo npm start

This will search for src/App.js and run the server.  By default this server is visible at port 3000, so in your browser of choice you can view its contents at localhost:3000.
